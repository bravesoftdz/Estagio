                      Distribution Policy
              Guidelines for Legal Re-distribution

  1) This applies to both end-users and developers.
    
  2) You must not charge money for any part of the ZIP package.
     Warning:  The primary concern here is if you will market a
     new package that is only slightly more than a verbatim copy 
     of this package, or one of its demos.  ANY release you sell
     is OK as long as you charge ONLY for the changes you make.

  3) You MUST either distribute the source code for this ZIP
     package, or give a WWW site where it can be obtained
     freely. This can be on a Help...About screen, in printed
     documentation, or in text files distributed with your 
     package.  Yes, it does seem odd to have this requirement
     for end-users who aren't programmers, but there is no
     mistake.  After all, it isn't hard to give them a URL
     and a few words explaining what it is for.

  4) You must document the Info-Zip's WWW home page URL, but 
     don't expect any help from the Info-Zip group, since my 
     release is only a derrivitive of their work.  They are 
     very busy doing support for their "official" releases.
     Since much of the DLL source code comes from them, they
     deserve to be mentioned.

  5) You must handle product support with your own end-users.
     This is needed because we don't have enough time to do
     support for end-users.

  6) We will handle support issues with programmers using this 
     package on a time-available basis. Since this is being
     distributed as freeware, you can't expect the kind of 
     support you'd get from a commercial vendor.  Please limit
     your questions to those that directly pertain to this
     ZIP package.

  7) You may NOT distribute executable versions of the demo
     programs to end-users without my approval.  These are 
     only example applications to teach you how to use
     this package.
