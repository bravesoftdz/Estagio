Recent changes
1.77.2.0
   OnAfterCallback renamed to OnCheckTerminate
   ProcessMessages not called and cursor not changed if not running main thread.
1.77.1.0
   Renamed some units - this should help reduce some compiler problems when more than one version are (or have been) installed.
    NOTE ZipMstr.pas is now ZipMstr177.pas so you may need to update some 'uses' clauses.
     
   Removed the event OnZipStr - this has been replaced by global function which can be set to new handler
     see vcl\ZpStrs177.pas 
       function SetZipStr(handler: TZipStrEvent): TZipStrEvent;
